## 🎯 Dataset Information

- **Total Classes**: 73 beverage bottle types
- **Images**: 5000+ training images
- **Format**: YOLO format with bounding box annotations
- **Categories**: Various bottle sizes, brands, and packaging types

## 🚀 Training Strategy

### Phase 1: Initial Training (50 Epochs)
- **Model**: YOLOv8n (Nano) with pre-trained weights
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Purpose**: Base model training and validation
- **Saved as**: `models/checkpoints/model_epoch_50.pt`

### Phase 2: Extended Training (150 Epochs)
- **Model**: Resume from Phase 1 checkpoint
- **Total Epochs**: 150
- **Purpose**: Fine-tuning and performance optimization
- **Final Model**: `models/best_models/best_beverage_model.pt`

## 💻 Code Structure

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```python
# Mount Google Drive and install dependencies
# Create project directory structure
# Initialize CUDA and GPU settings
```

### Step 2: Dataset Preparation
```python
# Extract dataset from ZIP file
# Update data.yaml with correct paths
# Verify dataset structure and file counts
```

### Step 3: Training Configuration
```python
# Initialize training class with checkpointing
# Configure training parameters
# Setup automatic state saving and resuming
```

### Step 4: Model Training - Phase 1
```python
# Train for 50 epochs
# Save checkpoint at epoch 50
# Validate initial performance
```

### Step 5: Model Training - Phase 2
```python
# Resume from epoch 50 checkpoint
# Continue training to 150 epochs
# Save best model with highest mAP score
```

## 🏆 Best Practices Implemented

- ✅ **Automatic Checkpointing**: Saves progress every 10 epochs
- ✅ **Resume Training**: Continues from last checkpoint if interrupted
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: JSON log file tracks training state
- ✅ **Google Drive Integration**: All files saved to persistent storage
- ✅ **Memory Optimization**: Proper batch size and worker configuration
- ✅ **Validation Monitoring**: Regular validation during training
- ✅ **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting with patience parameter
- ✅ **Model Versioning**: Organized checkpoint and best model storage

## 📊 Training Parameters

```python
EPOCHS_PHASE_1 = 50
EPOCHS_PHASE_2 = 150
IMG_SIZE = 640
BATCH_SIZE = 16
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.5
DEVICE = "GPU" if available else "CPU"
```

## 🎬 Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: Initial Training (50 Epochs)
1. Run setup and dataset preparation
2. Initialize trainer with YOLOv8n pretrained weights
3. Train for 50 epochs
4. Model saved as `model_epoch_50.pt`

### Phase 2: Extended Training (150 Epochs)  
1. Load checkpoint from Phase 1
2. Continue training for additional 100 epochs (total 150)
3. Best model saved as `best_beverage_model.pt`

## 📈 Expected Results

- **Phase 1 (50 epochs)**: Basic bottle detection capability
- **Phase 2 (150 epochs)**: Optimized performance with higher mAP scores
- **Final Model**: Production-ready beverage detection system

## 🔧 Training Monitoring

- Training plots automatically generated in `runs/` directory
- Loss curves, precision, recall, and mAP metrics tracked
- Validation performed every epoch
- Best weights saved based on validation mAP score
